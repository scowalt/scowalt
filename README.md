### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Scott Walters, a developer currently located in the Greater Seattle Area ðŸŒ²<img width="13" height="13" alt="United States" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f1fa-1f1f8.png?v8">. I currently work for [@OfficeDev](https://github.com/OfficeDev) ('19-Present). In the past, I've worked for [@MicrosoftEdge](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge) ('15-'18) and [@SIGMusic](https://github.com/SIGMusic) ('13-'15).

### Disclaimer

My lawyer advised me to say that my contributions outside of Microsoft repositories don't represent Microsoft. At time of writing, most of the contributions from this account represent my own work that was done on my own time.
